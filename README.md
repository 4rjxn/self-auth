# Open-source Authenticator App

## Overview

This is an **Authenticator App** built using Flutter, providing two-factor authentication (2FA) capabilities. The app is designed to be simple, fast, and user-friendly, while maintaining a strong level of security for its users. The project is currently under **active development**, with a focus on adding a **backup feature** to allow users to securely back up their authentication credentials.

Additionally, the backend for the application is designed to be **self-hostable**, offering flexibility and control for developers or organizations who wish to host their own instance.

Since the project is still evolving, there isn't a definitive name yet, but it will be updated as development progresses.
